Descriptive logic:
* Nodes are used to characterise concepts 
* Mother IS-A Parent
* Concept of parent has a property that is called a role, expressed by a link
    from the concept to a node for the role labelled as hasChild
* A parent is a person having at least one child, and all of his/her
  children are persons
the concept Mother , i.e., a female parent, is a more specific descendant of both the concepts Female and Parent, and as a result inherits from Parent the link to Person through the role hasChild; in other words, Mother inherits the restriction on its hasChild role from Parent
