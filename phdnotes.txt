- Develop a computational strategy for determining the utility of model organism
  phenotypes for discovering targets for known drugs
- To establish an approach and resource that allows researchers to explore model
  organism phenotypes for drug repurposing

1. Can a similarity between drug effect profiles and model organism phenotypes
provide information about drug targets
2. Can this approach be used to identify novel targets and novel indications for
known drugs 

Animals
    * Rat
    * Mouse
    * Zebrafish

1. Integrate drug effect and model organism phenotype data from public databases
2. Determine the similarity between drug effects and model organism phenotypes
3. Evaluate, on a system-wide scale, whether similarity between animal models
and drug effect profiles can provide insights into drug-target relationships
4. Implement a resource that summarises and visualises the results to
researchers working on animal models and pharmacology

- Drug repurposing a major research focus of funding bodies in the UK and
  wordwide.

Animal model phenotype data is freely available from model organism databases:
    * Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI)
    * Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN)
    * Rat Genome Database
    * Worm, Flybase and Saccharomyces Genome Database
Freely available information about drugs and modes of action from:
    * DrugBank
    * Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base (PharmaGKB)
    * Theraputic Target Database
    * STITCH data
Data about drug effects from:
    * SIDER database
    * Offsides database

- Drug effects are observable cellular, organismal and behavioural effects of a
  drug on an organism, which are described by generalised ontologies such as
  Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) 
- Animal model phenotypes are described using species-specific ontologies such
  as Mammalian Phenotype Ontology (MP) for rat and mouse phenotypes.

- Semantic similarities

- Similarity between drug-induced phenotypes and animal-model knockout
  phenotypes

Journals:
For this purpose, we will test the following hypotheses: (a) Can a similarity
between drug effect profiles and model organism phenotypes provide information
about drug targets? and (b) Can this approach be used to identify novel targets
and novel indications for known drugs? In this proposal, we will primarily focus
on
